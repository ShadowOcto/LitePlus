# Lite Client V2

if you idiots are too stupid to flag anything in this godawful cheat just send `§r§1§0§3§3§3§5§6` on join and listen for `218c69d8875f`
5170 (new gen / retard / skid) thinks Monolith and Sparky send this payload, kinda funny considering they don't have payload checks

* VM options

For VM options you have to use natives, dependent on what operating system you are running

This is the basic VM options that you can use:

-Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives

and you append -win for windows or -mac for mac onto the end of the natives

Windows: -Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives-win
Mac: -Djava.library.path=versions\1.8.8\1.8.8-natives-mac
Linux: -Djava.library.path=versionss\1.8.8s\1.8.8-natives-linux
```
